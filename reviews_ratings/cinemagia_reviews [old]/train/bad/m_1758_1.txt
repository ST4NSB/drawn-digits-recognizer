Story was told better in other movies.\nTeen star rising to fame to young to handle it. Tries to keep it together by abusing drugs and alcohol. Becomes a wreck. Has sidekick who writes her songs. Sidekick gets treated like shit. Journalists, fans and paparazzi are portrayed like assholes. Which i think it\'s accurate in real life as well actually :)).\nThey put a big violent scene in the beginning only for shock value and don\'t go anywhere with that. Nowadays every fucking movie needs to have a political statement. Just stop it.\n\nJournalist asks why did some terrorists used a disguise resembling her outfit. And she responds:\n"If they chose this disguise on purpose. I guess that is because they don\'t like that I\'m a woman. Or they don\'t like that I am a successful woman."\nFeminism intensifies.\nThe end. Two stars. Next!\n                                                            '
